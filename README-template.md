## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### Continued development

There are two problems I concerned.
1, Is it right to first determine the "width" and "height" of the "card", then add the "padding" or "margin" the flow the inner content in the right position?
2, To make the eye icon in the middle of the Equilibrium picture and also the cyan color layer when hovering the picture. I use two layer. Because the first one should not be opacity while the second one should be half opacity. Maybe there are better solution.
